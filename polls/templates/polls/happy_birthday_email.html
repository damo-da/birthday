    Happy Birthday my dear friend {{ first_name }},
</p>

<p>
    On this exact month and this exact day of the year {{ birth_year }}, you saw this world for the first time. Many
    days have passed since then; but today is auspicious for you to once again revisit the fundamentals. <em>Why</em> do
    you exist? Or better yet, <em>how</em> can you exist? If the universe had a beginning, and even time had a
    beginning, what are those that existed outside and before? Or does that make no sense? What does it even mean "to
    exist"? All humans are complicated; but, are we really? Are you complicated? Do you understand yourself? What are
    you made up of? What is your <em>true</em> age? What's the difference between you and a computer?
</p>
<p>
    My friend, today is a vital day for you. It signifies that your life had a beginning, and will ultimately perish.
    Take a break from regular activities to look at it from a new perspective. You might discover something significant
    about yourself. And after you've spent the day pondering about all that exists, it is time to celebrate existence.
    With cake, friends and families, and lots of love. (maybe a little bit of booze too? Well, if you get some, don't
    forget to invite me to the party!)
</p>
<p>
    It's your birthday today; so you're <em>{{ superhero }}</em> for the next 24 hours. You have noticed that this world
    is filled with misery, including those whose lives are miserable simply because they can not afford for their basic
    needs such as food, education or health. What if you made a small contribution to help such a person out there? It
    could be money but doesn't really have to. Also, the amount of donation does not really matter; it is just the act
    of contributing which does. I myself have donated {{ my_donation_amount | currency }} on this day (as {{
    superhero_article }} {{ superhero }} fan!) to someone out there crying for help. As a superhero, it's time for you
    to help someone out there too!
