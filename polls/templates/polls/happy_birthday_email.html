    Celebration in, Celebration out!

<p>
    Happy Birthday my dear friend {{ first_name }},
</p>

<p>
    A few years ago, on this exact day, you saw this world for the first time after your mother gave birth to you. Many
    many days have passed since then; and today is such a special day for you to remind yourself the significance of
    being alive. It is the day to remind yourself the reason why you're breathing. It is the day to make a prayer to the
    Lord, if there exists one, will a heart full of gratitude. And most importantly, it is also the day to reevaluate
    whether you are making yourself and your family and the people close to you happier or not.
</p>
<p>
    It's your birthday today; so you're the superhero of the day. You're today's {{ superhero }}. You have noticed that
    this world is filled with misery, including those whose lives are miserable simply because they can not afford for
    their basic needs such as food, education or health. What if you made a small contribution to help such a person out
    there? It could be money but doesn't really have to. Also, the amount of donation does not really matter; it is the
    act of contributing which does. I myself have donated {{ my_donation_amount | currency }} on this day (as
    {{ superhero_article }} {{ superhero }} fan!) to someone out there crying for help. As a superhero, it's time for you to
    help someone out there too!
</p>

<p>
    Fun fact: You have lived for {{ num_days_since_birth }} days. {{ num_days_since_birth }} can also be found at the
    {{ pi_index }} position after the decimal of Ï€. Verify <a href="https://www.angio.net/pi/bigpi.cgi" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
    Have a great day ahead my friend,<br/>
